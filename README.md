## Dataset Context

There are many human facial expression datasets but for mangas (japanese comics) there are none. I hope this tiny dataset would be a good starting point to show the power of manga faces to reflect emotions.


## Dataset Content
The dataset consists of several emotions (The number next to them is count of it):
<li> Pleased (38)
<li> Angry (54)
<li> Crying (56)
<li> Sad (57)
<li> Embarrassed (67)
<li> Happy (87)
<li> Shock/Surprised (103)
